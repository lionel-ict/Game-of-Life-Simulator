# Lionel's Game of Life Simulator

A simple Conway's Game of Life simulator I developed in Java for fun and learning.

Features:
- Play / Pause / Step-by-step simulation.
- Change simulation speed.
- Manualy kill/spawn individual cells.
- Resize cell world at will.
- Kill all cells (clear screen).
- Randomize all cells (for the unexpected).
- Save/Load simulation state to/from file.

Developed in Java SE 1.8 using Eclipse Oxygen with simple graphics using Java2D library (I know, not a good one, I just wanted something quick and easy) and the Jackson library to save/load simulation state as JSON gzip files.
