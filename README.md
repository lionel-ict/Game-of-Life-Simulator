# Lionel's Game of Life Simulator
A simple Conway's Game of Life simulator I developed in Java for fun and learning.

If you want to try it: [download executable jar file](https://github.com/lionel-ict/game-of-life-simulator/raw/master/LionelsGameOfLifeSimulator/lionels-game-of-life.jar)

**Features:**
- Play / Pause / Step-by-step simulation with ability to change speed.
- Manualy kill/spawn individual cells with simple mouse-click.
- Resize cell world at will, up to around 1 million cells.
- Easily kill all cells (to clear screen) or random world (for simulating the unexpected).
- Save/Load simulation states to/from file easily.

Developed in Java SE 1.8 using Eclipse Oxygen with simple Java2D graphics library
and the Jackson library to save/load simulations as JSON files.
